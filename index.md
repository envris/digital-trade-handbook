on_page_title: Digital Delivery Handbook
---

This handbook is intended for the _Busting Congestion for Agricultural Exporters_ program team at the [Department of Agriculture, Water and the Environment](https://www.awe.gov.au/) in the Australian Government.

It's a guide to how we work, including:

* how our teams are organised
* the agile and human-centred design processes we follow
* our technology and design choices

# The handbook is for two audiences

The handbook is for people in the department who might work with our digital delivery teams to deliver a product or service.

It explains why we take an agile approach to our work and what to expect when you work with our teams.

The handbook is also for digital specialists who come to work in our product teams, like developers, designers and user researchers.

It describes the default way that we do things in our digital teams, to help you get started faster.


# The handbook is a work in progress

We're continuously creating and improving the handbook. We will adapt and extend it from the practices that emerge and what we learn along the way.

At the moment, there will be pages that are missing or incomplete.

You can help contribute to the handbook. See our guide to [editing the handbook](./about-handbook/editing/).


# We're creating the handbook in the open

The handbook is a public document, which makes it easier for our teams and partners to access, and easier for everyone to contribute to.

It also lets others across government adapt and re-use our content.

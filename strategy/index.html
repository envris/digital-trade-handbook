        <p>We prioritise steel threads that span the whole user experience. On that foundation we deliver more complex user journeys.</p>
<p>Building new capabilities block-by-block risks building services that reflect our own structures -  not based on what users are trying to do. It also takes longer to get new services into the hands of users, increasing our risk.</p>
<p>These principles guide our decisions for delivery:</p>
<ul>
<li>Focus on <strong>user needs</strong> even over internal requirements.</li>
<li>Prioritise <strong>direct user value</strong> even over generic capabilities.</li>
<li>Deliver <strong>smaller, quicker increments</strong> even over larger, complex releases.</li>
<li>Make <strong>longer-term product and tech decisions</strong> even over short-term fixes.</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="service-transformation%2C-digitisation-and-digitalisation"><a class="header-anchor" href="#service-transformation%2C-digitisation-and-digitalisation">#</a> Service transformation, digitisation and digitalisation</h2>
<p>Service transformation is more than digitisation and digitalisation:</p>
<ul>
<li>'Digitisation' is about going from an analogue to digital format (for example, a paper form to a PDF).</li>
<li>'Digitalisation' is using technology to change business model and processes.</li>
<li>'Service transformation' is about improving people's experiences by building services that meet their needs.</li>
</ul>
<p>Transforming a service means improving the whole experiences for people, not the individual parts. It also requires us to improve the platforms and experience of people in government that support the service.</p>
<div class="callout-info"><ol>
<li>Digitisation: &quot;Welcome to the online version of our paper form. Your permit will be issues by mail in 30 days.&quot;</li>
<li>Digitalisation: &quot;We've redesigned our operations. Everything is more efficient and smooth. Thanks for using our online form. Here's your permit.&quot;</li>
<li>Service transformation: &quot;No more form - we've got data from other agencies you deal with. We've determined your risk level and you don't need a permit. By the way, you also qualify for this grant.&quot;</li>
</ol>

<h2 id="human-centred-design"><a class="header-anchor" href="#human-centred-design">#</a> Human-centred design</h2>
<p>We follow human-centred design. This means we involve the people we are designing for in every stage of the process.</p>
<p>We start with developing empathy for people. We test lots of ideas (hypotheses) with these people to work out what we should build. As we build, we keep testing our service with people to make sure we're building the right thing.</p>
<p>As we release we keep listening to people to work out how to make the service better.</p>
<h2 id="design-thinking"><a class="header-anchor" href="#design-thinking">#</a> Design thinking</h2>
<p>The design thinking mindset is a way of defining and solving complex problems by taking a human-centred approach.</p>
<p>Think of it as a methodology that helps you to identify and scope problems, understand people, challenge assumptions, and find new ways to solve problems.</p>
<h2 id="agile-approaches"><a class="header-anchor" href="#agile-approaches">#</a> Agile approaches</h2>
<p>We use agile approaches, rather than one fixed framework (such as SAFe).&quot;</p>
<p>Agile is an umbrella term that refers to frameworks, practices, processes and mindsets. What they have in common is their intent to:</p>
<ul>
<li>optimise work to create the greatest value</li>
<li>identify and adapt to change</li>
<li>keep on improving.</li>
</ul>
<p>Agile frameworks are generally used by teams. But agile can scale from individuals to multinational organisations.</p>
<p>Teams that follow agile approaches work in the open. This means they encourage engagement, validation and feedback of their work. As a result, teams build from an evidence-based foundation. They also refine their approach based on new knowledge.</p>
<p>Agile works for many different things. This includes, policy, education, manufacturing, military and other specialist fields.</p>

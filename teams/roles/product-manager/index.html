        <h1 class="title">Product manager</h1>

        <p>The product manager leads the multi-disciplinary team to deliver a digital product or service that meets users' needs.</p>
<p>The product manager plays a leading role in:</p>
<ul>
<li>setting the vision and roadmap for the product</li>
<li>working with the product's stakeholders</li>
<li>prioriting the backlog and what gets done in a sprint</li>
<li>ensuring user stories are completed to a high quality</li>
</ul>
<p>The product manager works closely with the <a href="../delivery-manager/">delivery manager</a> to make sure the team are working to achievable goals and are on track to deliver.</p>
<p><div class="table-of-contents"><h1>On this page:</h1><ol><li><a href="#setting-the-vision-and-roadmap"> Setting the vision and roadmap</a></li><li><a href="#working-with-stakeholders"> Working with stakeholders</a></li><li><a href="#prioritising-the-backlog"> Prioritising the backlog</a></li><li><a href="#accepting-stories-when-they're-done"> Accepting stories when they're done</a></li></ol></div></p>
<h1 id="setting-the-vision-and-roadmap"><a class="header-anchor" href="#setting-the-vision-and-roadmap">#</a> Setting the vision and roadmap</h1>
<p>It's the role of the product manager to define the vision for the product and communicate it with the team and stakeholders.</p>
<p>A good product vision aligns to both the user needs you've identified and the organisation's priorities.</p>
<p>The vision is often the end goal for a product roadmap that explains what features and milestones will be achieved along the way.</p>
<p>It's common for the vision and roadmap to be iterated over time, based on what the team learns from users and delivery.</p>
<h1 id="working-with-stakeholders"><a class="header-anchor" href="#working-with-stakeholders">#</a> Working with stakeholders</h1>
<p>The product manager is often the primary 'face' of the team to stakeholders inside and outside the department, like colleagues in operational areas or external industry groups.</p>
<p>By hearing the priorities of different stakeholders, the product manager can make informed decisions about the work to prioritise.</p>
<p>Stakeholders can be great advocates for the product and the team, and often give helpful feedback on features.</p>
<div class="callout-alert"><p>Stakeholder feedback is helpful, but it's not a substitute for good user research. You'll hear different perspectives from both.</p>
</div>
<h1 id="prioritising-the-backlog"><a class="header-anchor" href="#prioritising-the-backlog">#</a> Prioritising the backlog</h1>
<p>The product manager is responsible for the backlog, and gets the final say on which user stories are or aren't included in <a href="../../../agile/sprints">a sprint</a>.</p>
<p>They are responsible for making sure that user stories have the right level of detail and clear acceptance criteria before they are prioritised.</p>
<p>In prioritising the backlog, the product manager has to balance:</p>
<ul>
<li>delivering new features</li>
<li>making improvements to existing features</li>
<li>fixing bugs and issues</li>
<li>addressing technical debt</li>
</ul>
<h1 id="accepting-stories-when-they're-done"><a class="header-anchor" href="#accepting-stories-when-they're-done">#</a> Accepting stories when they're done</h1>
<p>The product manager plays an important role at the end of the process, by 'accepting' user stories as they are completed by the team.</p>
<div class="callout-info"><p>The requirements for a story, called the <em>acceptance criteria</em>, should be defined before the work begins.</p>
</div>
<p>Accepting a user story means checking that the work has been completed to an acceptable level of quality.</p>
<p>This sometimes includes:</p>
<ul>
<li>checking if a feature has been released into the production environment</li>
<li>confirming that a fix has correctly addressed the issue</li>
<li>looking at analytics to understand if a new feature is meeting the user need</li>
</ul>
